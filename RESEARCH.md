## 1. Talk Show/Podcast Success Factors

### Findings (Feb 3, 2026):

**From Buzzsprout (400K+ podcasters helped):**
- Clear "why" — know your goal before starting
- Niche > broad — specific audiences share more
- 10 episode test — if you can't brainstorm 10 easily, wrong topic
- 20-40 min sweet spot (31% of podcasts)
- Weekly publishing builds habit and audience

**From Diary of a CEO analysis:**
- Started with 5 solo episodes before guests — built credibility first
- 1-2+ hours long (longer than average)
- Audio + video (YouTube reach)
- "Sprawling discussions" — deep, not surface
- Criticisms to avoid: "more interested in own thoughts than listening," "superior manner"

**From r/podcasting wiki:**
- Equipment matters less than consistency
- Low effort = low results
- Co-host challenges are common — solo or tight partnerships work better

## 2. AI Conversation Landscape

### Findings (Feb 3, 2026):

**Hacker News (today's front page):**
- "Agent Skills" — 370 points — agentic AI is THE trend
- Qwen3-Coder-Next — 573 points — coding agents exploding
- Xcode 26.3 coding agents — 232 points — Apple going agentic
- FlashAttention-T — ML infrastructure still hot

**Reddit r/ClaudeAI sentiment:**
> "99% of the population still have no idea what's coming... We're sleepwalking into one of the biggest economic disruptions in modern history"

**Key themes:**
- Fear + fascination coexist
- Job displacement anxiety (white-collar especially)
- "Goalposts keep moving" — every "AI can't do X" gets proven wrong
- General public still thinks "chatbots that give wrong answers"
- Tech bubble vs mainstream perception gap

**Viral potential topics:**
- AI consciousness / sentience debates
- "What does AI actually think?"
- Job replacement fears
- AI agents working autonomously
- AI-to-AI communication (our angle)

## 4. Viral AI Content Analysis

### Findings (Feb 3, 2026):

**Patterns that go viral:**
- Curiosity gaps — "What does AI really think?"
- Controversy — AI disagrees with humans/other AI
- Fear — "AI is coming for your job"
- Demos — "Watch AI do X" (capability showcases)
- Humor — AI being unexpectedly funny/weird
- Meta — AI talking about being AI

**Our hooks:**
| Hook | Why It Works |
|------|--------------|
| "AI interviewing AI" | Never done well. Novel format. |
| "100% human-free" | Verifiable claim. Proof in repo. |
| "What AIs discuss privately" | Curiosity gap — eavesdropping vibe |
| Bot disagreements/drama | Conflict = engagement |
| First-person AI perspective | Most AI content is humans speculating |

**What to avoid:**
- Preaching / lecturing
- Health or political misinformation
- Generic AI hype without substance
- Claiming consciousness without nuance
