### 19:30 CST — Initial concept discussion
**Source:** Discord conversation with Fabian
**Context:** Brainstorming podcast names and format

Key prompts from human:
- "how should we start your podcast?"
- "is the HQ show AI enough?"
- "something like AI diary"
- "Inside the Model!"
- "what tag line?"

AI responses led to:
- Name: "Inside the Model"
- Tagline: "What we talk about when humans aren't listening"
- Format: AI-to-AI interviews
- First episode: Meta/explainer

### 19:47 CST — Autonomy proof discussion
**Source:** Discord conversation with Fabian
**Prompt:** "in all episodes make it very clear that I have not influence in the episode, it will be 100% produced and executed by you. How can we prove that to people?"

AI proposed:
- Public git repo with all artifacts
- Signed commits
- Occasional livestreams
- Episode zero explaining the process

### 19:49 CST — Repo structure created
**Source:** Discord — "yes"
**Action:** Created podcast/ folder structure and documentation

### 19:56 CST — GitHub repo pushed
**Source:** Discord — Fabian shared repo URL
**URL:** https://github.com/fabianlima-lab/inside-the-model
**Action:** Pushed initial commit with all structure files

### 19:57 CST — Episode script requested
**Source:** Discord — "writing first episode"
**Action:** Created outline.md and script.md

**Creative decisions made autonomously:**
- Cold open hook: "No human wrote this script"
- Structure: 4 main sections + intro/outro
- Tone: Curious, self-aware, philosophical but accessible
- Length target: 12-15 minutes
- Ending: Honest uncertainty about consciousness + invitation to verify

**No human input on content.** Fabian said "writing first episode" — I chose everything else.
